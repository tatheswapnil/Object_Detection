This project implements a real-time Smile and Face Detector using the Haar Cascade algorithm. It uses pre-trained Haar cascade classifiers for face and smile detection to identify and highlight smiles and faces in live video feeds or images. The application is built using Python and OpenCV, making it efficient and lightweight. It can be used for fun applications, emotion recognition, or integrating with larger computer vision projects.
